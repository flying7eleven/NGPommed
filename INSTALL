of libofapi.


Installing
----------

To install pommed:
 - copy pommed somewhere in your PATH (/usr/bin)
 - copy pommed/data/* to /usr/share/pommed
 - copy pommed.conf.(mactel|pmac) as /etc/pommed.conf
 - install the pommed.init initscript as /etc/init.d/pommed, make it executable
   and perform any additional configuration needed on your system (links to
   /etc/rc?.d/ for instance)
 - configure DBus for pommed
    + if you have a /etc/dbus-1/system.d directory, copy dbus-policy.conf
      as /etc/dbus-1/system.d/pommed.conf
    + otherwise, copy dbus-policy.conf as /etc/dbus-1/pommed.conf and add 
          <include>pommed.conf</include>
      in /etc/dbus-1/system.conf, between the <busconfig>...</busconfig> tags
      (usually toward the end of the file, before the </busconfig> tag)
 - restart dbus

Icons for gpomme are available in the icons/ directory. For the .desktop files
provided with gpomme to work, the icons should be installed under
/usr/share/icons/hicolor. PNG files go to the appropriate sub-directory
depending on their size, gpomme.svg goes to the scalable/ sub-directory.

Pick an icon from the icons/ directory to display in the dock. You can install
gpomme_32x32.xpm to /usr/share/pixmaps/wmpomme.xpm and use that in the dock for
instance.
